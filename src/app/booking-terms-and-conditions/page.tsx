            From time-to-time and in order to ensure and continue to maintain
            the highest levels of safety and standards, the Executive Cessna
            Grand Caravan used for SkySafari flights will be required to
            undertake scheduled and unscheduled maintenance works. In both
            cases, SkySafari will ensure an alternate aircraft is available from
            a third party, to undertake any and all flight commitments. In the
            event that the Executive Cessna Grand Caravan aircraft used for
            SkySafari flights is not available due to any reason, including but
            not limited to, scheduling reasons, SkySafari will ensure an
            alternate aircraft is available from a third party, to undertake any
            and all flight commitments.
            <br />
            In such events, SkySafari cannot guarantee the same interior layout
            to that of the Executive Cessna Grand Caravan regularly used by
            SkySafari and in such cases the affected Guest may be due, at the
            sole discretion of SkySafari management, compensation not exceeding
            US$50 per sector per Guest and only where a third-party aircraft was
            used on any such sector.
            <br />
            The aircraft used by SkySafari is configured to carry eight
            passengers in eight comfortable passenger seats, including two,
            non-reclining divan-type seats at the rear of the cabin. On specific
            requests, and subject to approval by the flight service provider,
            SkySafari will accept and book a ninth passenger who will be seated
            in the co-pilot seat. Seating allocation on SkySafari flights is
            free seating and the Pilot in Command has the authority to determine
            the seating arrangement of any flight due to safety considerations.

            riots, acts of war, and acts of terrorism, Industrial dispute,
